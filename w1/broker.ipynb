    "- Reward function is if the person want's to schedule a viewing (determined by LLM as a judge with personal info for the time being)\n",

    "    - Explore neighborhood\n",

    "## What I would like to improve on\n",
    "- Better file search: Should gather more data and consider organizing it by neighborhood, provide more context on the schema\n",
    "- Better search by keywords (a budget of 4000 should include listings less than 4k but now fails because i'im comparing on ints)\n",
    "- Larger apartment dataset for testing\n",
    "- Refine tool usage (web search is one of the more powerful tools and i'd expect to see it called more often)"
