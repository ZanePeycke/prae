    "- Tools:\n",
    "    - Apartment Text search\n",

    "    - Explore neighborhood\n",

    "## What I would like to improve on\n",
    "- Better file search: Should gather more data and consider organizing it by neighborhood, provide more context on the schema\n",
    "- Better search by keywords (a budget of 4000 should include listings less than 4k but now fails because i'im comparing on ints)\n",
    "- Larger apartment dataset for testing\n",
    "- Analyze tool usage\n",
    "- Re add [Open Street Map MCP](https://github.com/jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp) for better directions and explorations\n",

      "- **1 Bed (alcove studio), south facing, private balcony**\n",
      "- Abundant light, quiet, just above the budget.\n",

      "- **Price:** $4,000/month\n",
      "- **1 Bed, south-facing, balcony, duplex loft**\n",
      "- Not Chelsea/West Village, but very close to 1,2,3 trains, Citibike, with neighborhood cafes and highly rated coffee shops (Lavazza, Irving Farm) nearby, and near Central Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 10 Gay St #4B (West Village) and 2 Grove St #4A (West Village)\n",
      "- **Prices:** $4,995/month and $6,800/month (over budget)\n",
      "- Very desirable, historic West Village properties with great light/views and access to top coffee shops (Partners Coffee, Stumptown), but over budget.\n",

      "- **Citibike:** Multiple stations, including W 20th & 8th, W 20th & 11th.\n",
      "- **Subways:** West 18th, 14th, and 23rd on the 1 line (also 2,3 at 14th).\n",

      "- **Best combo of: price, natural light, safety from bar noise, unbeatable access to food/coffee, Citibike, and 1/2/3 subways—all within 5 minutes.**\n",
      "- **Excellent neighborhood, classic prewar charm, and a stellar building reputation.**\n",

       "EvaluationResult(reasoning=\"The response provides a very thorough and organized evaluation of the user's requirements: 1) It addresses neighborhood (West Village or Chelsea), size (1BR/1BA), budget (up to $4,000), emphasis on natural light and view, proximity to the 1/2/3 subway and Citibike, no bar below, and being very close to top-tier coffee shops. 2) It identifies an almost-complete match (Kensington House), but correctly and explicitly flags the studio/junior-1 layout as a possible issue for a user seeking a strict 1-bedroom. 3) It is candid about tradeoffs, stating that a strict 1BR within the exact budget and area may require a compromise (either higher rent or a location slightly farther from coffee shops or subways). 4) The response does not ignore any preference, and gives detailed evidence (listing location, neighborhood amenities, absence of bar below, etc.). The only deficiency is that the primary recommendation is a studio—not a strict 1BR, which the user requested. However, this is transparently disclosed, and the response offers next-step advice about potentially adjusting requirements. This is a minor and reasonable tradeoff, since it is difficult to find a strict 1BR in these areas within $4,000. Therefore, while not a perfect pass, it is the best possible answer given current market realities, with no deceptive contradictions or omissions. Strictness is maintained by flagging the 1BR limitation and being proactive about it.\", status='pass')"
