    "- Better file search: Should gather more data and consider organizing it by neighborhood, provide more context on the schema\n",
    "- Better search by keywords (a budget of 4000 should include listings less than 4k but now fails because i'im comparing on ints)\n",
    "- Larger apartment dataset for testing\n",
    "- Analyze tool usage\n",
    "- Re add [Open Street Map MCP](https://github.com/jagan-shanmugam/open-streetmap-mcp) for better directions and explorations\n",
    "- Error handling on context window limits for Claude"
